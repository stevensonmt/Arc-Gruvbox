Arc-Gruvbox is a GTK theme based on [Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) and using the [Gruvbox color scheme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

Due to too many instances of single value gradients that were generating lots of silent errors/warnings I have replaced this theme on my system with [earthy](https://github.com/stevensonmt/earthy), which was based on the Nordic theme but with gruvbox inspired colors.
